  "email_body": "Dear Professor,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Ruiming Kang, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin, currently in my third year. I have a strong interest in pursuing research opportunities within your esteemed lab, particularly in the field of computer vision.\n\nI was particularly inspired by your publications on semantic segmentation and dense conditional random fields, as well as your projects focusing on deep learning techniques. My experience as a Student Researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas, where I contributed to the advancement of noise reduction materials, has equipped me with valuable skills in MATLAB and Python programming, which I believe would be beneficial in your lab's ongoing research.\n\nI would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss any potential openings in your research group. Thank you for considering my inquiry.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRuiming Kang\nAustin, TX | (469)-407-5201 | rkang@utexas.edu | ruimingkang.com",
  "cover_letter": "Dear Professor,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in joining your research group as an undergraduate researcher, particularly to contribute to your projects surrounding computer vision and deep learning. My name is Ruiming Kang, a Mechanical Engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin, and I am driven by my passion for advancing technology through research.\n\nI have closely followed your work on semantic segmentation with deep convolutional networks and fully connected conditional random fields, both of which have profound implications in the realm of computer vision. My background in Mechanical Engineering equips me with a solid foundation in both technical skills and analytical thinking, while my hands-on experiences, such as my recent role as a Student Researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas, have honed my ability to conduct experimental research and analyze complex datasets.\n\nIn my previous role, I designed and executed impact tests on various materials, utilizing advanced data analysis techniques including digital image correlation in MATLAB, as well as creating insightful visualizations through Python. Additionally, as a Tech Lead for the University of Texas Chinese Students and Scholars Association, I demonstrated my capability to lead a team in developing software solutions, showcasing my proficiency in programming languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML.\n\nI am particularly intrigued by your project \"Deep Learning for Computer Vision\" and its application in object detection and image synthesis. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing my skills and collaborating with you and your team to further explore these areas.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your esteemed research group.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRuiming Kang\nAustin, TX | (469)-407-5201 | rkang@utexas.edu | ruimingkang.com"
