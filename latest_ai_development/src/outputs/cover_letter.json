  "email_body": "Dear Professor,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. My name is Ruiming Kang, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin with a keen interest in robotics and materials science. I recently came across your work on mobile robot localization and terrain adaptive navigation, which strongly resonates with my research experiences and aspirations.\n\nI have hands-on experience in conducting experiments and analyzing data through my recent role as a Student Researcher at the Mechanics of Advanced Materials Laboratory at the University of Texas at Dallas. This involved utilizing advanced materials and MATLAB for mechanical stress analysis, which I believe could contribute positively to your research group. \n\nI am eager to explore potential research opportunities in your laboratory and would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss my qualifications and interests further. Thank you for considering my inquiry, and I look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\nRuiming Kang\n(469)-407-5201\nrkang@utexas.edu\nruimingkang.com",
  "cover_letter": "Dear Professor,\n\nI am writing to express my interest in research opportunities within your esteemed lab at the University of Texas. My name is Ruiming Kang, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a GPA of 3.52. I am particularly drawn to your innovative projects on mobile robot localization and adaptive navigation, as they align perfectly with my academic background and research interests.\n\nDuring my time as a Student Researcher at the Mechanics of Advanced Materials Laboratory at the University of Texas at Dallas, I contributed to research focused on noise reduction in automotive tires. This involved engineering advanced materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, which cultivated my passion for integrating material science with robotics. My experience in designing and executing mechanical impact tests, along with employing MATLAB for digital image correlation analysis, has equipped me with strong analytical skills that I am eager to apply to your projects.\n\nAdditionally, my position as a TechLead at the University of Texas Chinese Students and Scholars Association allowed me to sharpen my technical skills in software development, where I led a team in creating solutions that enhanced user engagement during large events.\n\nI am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to your work and learning from your expertise. I am confident that my technical skills and research experience offer a unique perspective to your lab. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your ongoing research.\n\nSincerely,\nRuiming Kang\nAustin, TX\n(469)-407-5201\nrkang@utexas.edu\nruimingkang.com"
